<p>This project, designed by Julian Quevedo, Michael Robertson,
and Brion Ye for the Phys14N class taught by Professor Monika Schleier-Smith,
is designed to educate students about the properties and utility of quantum error correction,
the working principle behind a well-known basic error correction scheme known as Shor‚Äôs 9-bit code,
and the future of quantum error correction.</p>

<h1 id="1-what-is-quantum-computing-why-does-it-matter">1. What is quantum computing? Why does it matter?</h1>
<p>Quantum computing, to put it simply, is a potential candidate for complete computational revolution. It revolves around the concept of qubits ‚Äì unlike a classical bit that is always either discretely 0 or 1, a qubit is able to remain in a quantum superposition of 0 and 1. Quantum algorithms exploit this superposition to perform simultaneous calculations on exponentially more logical states than possible with a classical computer.
The concept was first imagined (in the form of a quantum Turing-complete machine) in the early 1980s by a physicist named Paul Benioff. Subsequently, other physicists and computer scientists became attracted to the notion of quantum computing, believing that it will possess abilities beyond that of a classical computer. In 1994, Peter Shor created one of the first concrete examples of a relevant use case for quantum computing when he introduced a quantum algorithm which could factorize large integers into their prime factors in polynomial time. For the first time, the exponential speedup and practical applications of quantum computing were realized ‚Äì at least in theory. Though Shor‚Äôs algorithm was universally acclaimed, many scientists doubted that it would ever become more than a theoretical interest.</p>

<h1 id="2-why-do-we-need-quantum-error-correction">2. Why do we need quantum error correction?</h1>
<p>By the 90s, physicists were well aware of the sensitive nature of quantum systems, as even the smallest of unintended interactions could destroy the state of a qubit. They knew that quantum circuits had to be cooled to near absolute zero and be extremely well-shielded from the environment. With systems as sensitive as single atoms, it seemed inevitable that algorithms such as Shor‚Äôs would fall apart due to a phenomenon known as quantum decoherence.</p>

<p>Quantum decoherence is the result of an unintended interaction between a qubit and the environment, which ends up irreversibly disturbing the qubit‚Äôs wavefunction. By environment, we just mean everything outside our quantum subsystem. The environment is out of our control; we cannot measure it or apply quantum gates to investigate it. Because of this, interactions with the environment appear to destroy the quantum information in our circuit, as we are unable to interact with it to retrieve the lost information. The information is ‚Äúlost‚Äù in the first place because, when two quantum objects interact, they become correlated, or entangled, ‚Äúspreading‚Äù the information between them. If we could examine the universe‚Äôs wavefunction as a whole, we would see that information is conserved. However, our limited perspective only allows us to see half of the story, and hence we observe decoherence, the unpredictable, apparently non-unitary, loss of the original quantum states to the outside world. It is as if an unknown Hamiltonian has been ‚Äúturned on,‚Äù or as if an unwanted, unknown measurement has been made on the system.</p>

<p><img src="img/decoherence.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>With no practical way to perfectly shield our quantum circuits, we had to invent another way to circumvent the sensitivity of quantum systems and create large-scale quantum computers. Only then could we finally realize the prospects of things such as Shor‚Äôs factoring algorithm. The answer was quantum error correction.</p>

<h1 id="3-classical-vs-quantum-ec">3. Classical vs Quantum EC</h1>
<p>The breakthroughs in classical computing theory of the past decades have changed the world perhaps more than any other technology. We have already learned a lot about error correction in integrated circuits and transmission of data over the internet. Can‚Äôt we use that knowledge and experience and apply it to quantum circuits?</p>

<p>Much of classical error correction involves creating redundancies through making multiple copies of the desired information. Classical error codes also rely on making many measurements of the data over time. However, measurement inherently disturbs quantum states, meaning we should avoid measurements of qubit systems at all costs. This also means we cannot create copies of arbitrary quantum states due to the No-Cloning Theorem. The other difference is that classical error codes are mostly used in the transmission of data over distances. However, quantum systems are so sensitive that errors often arise even during processing, i.e. applying quantum gates. This means quantum error correcting codes will be needed much more frequently, basically all the time.</p>

<p><img src="img/entanglement.png" alt="" /></p>

<h1 id="4-types-of-quantum-errors">4. Types of Quantum Errors</h1>
<p>Bit-flip codes account for situations where \(\ket{0}\) gets flipped to \(\ket{1}\) or \(\ket{1}\) gets flipped to \(\ket{0}\). These errors are represented by the X operator.</p>

<p>Sign-flip codes, or phase-flip codes, account for situations when \(\ket{0} + \ket{1}\) becomes \(\ket{0} - \ket{1}\). These kinds of errors are represented by the Z operator.</p>

<p>Both of these types of phenomenon are encountered often in nature. In order to have what is known as a complete error correcting code, it must be able to deal with both bit-flips and phase-flips.</p>

<h1 id="5-the-bit-flip-code">5. The Bit-Flip Code</h1>

<p><img src="img/bit-flip-diagram" alt="" /></p>

<p>The first step of the process is encoding. Here we‚Äôre going to take advantage of quantum mechanics and create an entangled state. \(\ket{\psi}\)  is the state we want to keep in tact at the end of the day. Then, we have two CNOT gates applied one after another. This entangles all three qubits.</p>

<p>Next is the random environmental error. Since we are doing the bit flip code, we can correct for any rotation around the x axis.</p>

<p>In the decoding stage, this is where we hopefully ensure \(\ket{\psi}\)  has the correct state. The CNOTs are applied once more, followed by a Toffoli. The Toffoli will only activate if  both ancillas are a 1 at the time.</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs say each qubit in our circuit has probability p of X being applied to it ‚Äúby the environment‚Äù every timestep. To account for this, we can define one logical qubit using 3 physical qubits. For example, the \(\ket{0}\)  logical state will be expressed as \(\ket{000}\) and the \(\ket{1}\) logical state will be expressed as \(\ket{111}\). A classical algorithm would achieve this by simply making two copies of the original bit, then taking a ‚Äúmajority vote‚Äù at the end of processing. However, creating a copy of our desired qubit would necessarily disturb it. So, we instead distribute its information across two ancilla qubits using two sequential CNOT gates. The ancilla qubits are initially in the \(\ket{0}\) state, so, If our arbitrary state \(\ket{\psi}\)  is in the \(\ket{1}\) state, they will get flipped to the \(\ket{1}\) state as well. If \(\ket{\psi}\)  is in the \(\ket{0}\) state, nothing happens, and all qubits remain in the \(\ket{0}\) state.</p>

<p>Error codes are generally broken into a 3 step process: encoding, simulated error, and decoding. What we have so far is the encoding stage. Next is the error simulation, also called a ‚Äúnoisy channel,‚Äù in which any subset of three qubits may have X applied to them at random. Since p is the probability of a bit-flip, Each qubit has a probability of 1-p of being transmitted correctly.</p>

<p>The rest of the circuit involves applying another two CNOT gates in a similar fashion, followed by a CCNOT or Toffoli gate on psi. The Toffoli gate will only flip \(\ket{\psi}\) if both ancilla bits are in the \(\ket{1}\)  state. So, assuming only 1 qubit has been flipped in the noisy channel, let‚Äôs see how this circuit works!</p>

<p><img src="img/1-error.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>If the first bit is flipped, then the ancilla bits always become the \(\ket{1}\)  state, and thus the Toffoli takes care of the correction. If either of the ancilla bits are flipped, the Toffoli will not activate, so the state of \(\ket{\psi}\) is not disturbed.</p>

<p><img src="img/2-error.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>What happens if two bits are flipped? In this case, two bit-flips are indistinguishable from a single bit-flip on the other qubit. For example, if \(\ket{\psi}\) and one of the ancilla bits are flipped, the Toffoli will never activate, as the two ancilla bits will always be different. This means that \(\ket{\psi}\) will not be reverted to its original value. If instead it is both ancilla bits which are flipped, the Toffoli will activate on a false-positive, as they will both end up in the \(\ket{1}\)  state. This time, \(\ket{\psi}\) is accidentally flipped into the incorrect state, even though it was correct in the first place.</p>

<p><img src="img/3-error.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>What if all three bits are flipped? This situation turns out to be equivalent to no flips occurring at all. In this case, both ancilla bits will always end up in the \(\ket{0}\)  state, which will fail to activate the Toffoli and leave \(\ket{\psi}\) in the incorrect state.</p>

<p>In conclusion, the 3-bit code can only account for a single bit flip. In general, quantum error codes are unable to correct for all possible errors. So, they are optimized for the most probable errors.</p>

<p>Concretely, how much does using the 3-bit code help us? We know it will only work if 0 or 1 of our 3 qubits are flipped. The probability of none being flipped is \((1-p)^3\), while the probability of any single qubit being flipped is \(p(1-p)^2\). So, the combined probability of our error code reproducing the correct state is \((1-p)^3 + 3p(1-p)^2\). If we didn‚Äôt use error correction, the probability of \(\ket{\psi}\) being correctly transmitted is just 1-p, as mentioned before. The probability of perfectly reproducing the original state is a measure of what‚Äôs called fidelity. Plotting the fidelity vs \(p\), we see that the 3-bit code will result in higher fidelity as long as the probability of a bit flip is less than 50%. Once the probability becomes higher than 50%, however, the problems associated with 2 or 3 bit-flips dominate.</p>

<p><img src="img/fidelity.png" alt="" /></p>

<h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>
<p>This all makes sense in theory, but it is equally important to verify the bit-flip code experimentally. There are several popular quantum computing frameworks, but the one we‚Äôll be using is Qiskit for Python. If you don‚Äôt have it installed already, use the command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pip install qiskit</code>.</p>

<p>Start by importing the necessary modules. We‚Äôll be needing several <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">qiskit</code> functions such as the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Initialize</code> custom gate as well as a few functions for visualizing our experimental results.</p>

<p>Next, initialize the quantum circuit in the above diagram. We will need three qubits corresponding to \(q_0\), \(q_1\), and \(q_2\), as well as one classical bit to store our measurement results.</p>

<p>We want to be able to correct errors for any arbitrary state \(\ket{\psi}\). Define <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">s_init</code> to pick a random pair of amplitudes, using them to create a custom ‚Äúinitialization gate‚Äù which will be applied to \(q_0\) at the beginning of the program.</p>

<p>Next is the encoding stage. Simply apply two CNOT gates to the desired quantum circuit <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">qc</code>. The first parameters are the indexes of the control bit followed by the target bit, respectively. Since we want to entangle the ancillary bits, both of the controls should be set to the index of \(q_0\), <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0</code>.</p>

<p>Next, we need to introduce a random error, represented as a rotation about the \(x\)-axis by some arbitrary angle.</p>

<p>Now, decode the qubit by applying two more CNOT gates on the ancillary bits, followed by a Toffoli (CCNOT) whose target bit is \(q_0\).</p>

<p>Last but not least, measure the state of the original qubit and store the result in index <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0</code> of the classical register.</p>

<h1 id="6-the-phase-flip-code">6. The Phase-Flip Code</h1>
<p>As it is a close cousin of the bit-flip code, the circuit for correcting random phase-flips is very similar. The only difference is that there are three extra Hadamard gates at the end of the encoding sequence, and three more at the beginning of the decoding sequence.</p>

<p>For example, let‚Äôs say \(\ket{\psi}\) is \(\ket{0}\) . It will become \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\ket{0} + \ket{1})\) after passing through the Hadamard gate. Then, due to some environmental disturbance, it flips to the \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\ket{0} - \ket{1})\) state. After passing through the second Hadamard, it is now in the \(\ket{1}\)  state. The rest of the circuit decodes in exactly the same way as the bit-flip code did.</p>

<h2 id="implementation-1">Implementation</h2>
<p>Testing the phase-flip code with Qiskit is a very similar process. All we need to do is add the three Hadamard gates at the end of the encoding state and the beginning of the decoding stage!</p>

<h1 id="7-the-complete-shor-9-bit-code">7. The Complete Shor 9 Bit Code</h1>
<p>The above two three-bit codes are certainly useful for specific types of error, but they won‚Äôt be enough by themselves. A qubit ‚Äúerror‚Äù (whether it be an environmental disturbance or a malfunctioning logic gate or any other factor) can be generally expressed as a unitary operator of form \(E=aI+bX+cY+dZ\), where \(I/X/Y/Z\) are the Pauli operators and \(a/b/c/d\) are coefficients such that \(a^2+b^2+c^2+d^2=1\). Clearly the domain of possible unitary errors encompasses much more than a simple bit flip or phase flip.
However, what happens if we combine the two gates somehow? Notice that the expression for the error can be simplified: \(E=aI+bX+c(XZ)+dZ\). This is because a \(180^\circ\) \(Y\) axis rotation is equivalent to a \(180^\circ\) \(X\) rotation followed by a \(180^\circ\) \(Z\) rotation. Now the relationship becomes more clear; although \(E\) cannot be represented as pure \(X\) rotations or pure \(Z\) rotations, it can be entirely represented by a combination function of the two.
A graphical explanation on the Bloch Sphere may make things clearer. Say you have a qubit \(a\ket{0}+b\ket{1}\) that you want to transmit (the one displayed in the image is )
The bit-flip code is capable of correcting any error that places the qubit along the same circle about the \(X\)-axis:</p>

<p>The phase-flip code, in contrast, can handle anything along the same circle about the \(Z\)-axis:</p>

<p>By visual inspection, it is easy to see that rotating about these two axes by some amount will allow the qubit vector to travel anywhere on the Bloch sphere; and, conversely, to allow any error vector on the Bloch sphere to return to the same original point.</p>

<p>Shor‚Äôs 9-bit code does exactly this. A full circuit diagram is pictured below:</p>

<p>The circuit diagram looks intimidating. What are all those CNOT gates doing there? It‚Äôs hard to wrap our heads around this circuit directly, but things become a little clearer when we consider the seemingly recursive nature of the circuit. Take the middle sections of the circuit:</p>

<p>These three sections are identical to the circuit configuration for the 3-qubit bit flip code we discussed earlier! Each group of three qubits undergoes the same operation that corrects any bit-flip (or X rotation) that may have resulted from the noisy channel.</p>

<p>Next, look at the outer sections:</p>

<p>Yet again, we see a familiar face: the 3-qubit phase flip code also appears across every third qubit in the circuit! Each group of three qubits, represented by a single header qubit, collectively runs through this circuit to correct any phase-flip (or \(Z\) rotation) that may have resulted from the noisy channel.</p>

<p>In this way, the Shor code is akin to a quantum Lego set. When we send 9 entangled qubits, there could be both a bit flip and a phase flip hiding among them. The outer phase flip code only corrects for one type of error. However, if we split the 9 qubits into 3 logical ‚Äúgroups of qubits‚Äù and correct for the bit flip within, we can be sure that the ‚Äúlogical qubit‚Äù reaching the phase flip code is \(X\)-rotation-free. After the phase-flip is corrected, we are left with the final qubit that has been corrected of all types of error.</p>

<p>Feel free to explore the behind-the-scenes code that makes this run!</p>

<p>And here is an example of some modular pseudocode that makes the recursive nature of the Shor code clear:</p>

<p>When run in a quantum simulation, our results showed that the resulting output qubit always had the same coefficients as the input qubit. This relationship was upheld through trials across the entire domain of possible unitary errors on a single qubit.</p>

<h1 id="8-the-future-of-quantum-error-correction">8. The future of quantum error correction</h1>

<p>Although Shor‚Äôs 9-bit algorithm was a breakthrough in the sense that it provided the first example of working error correction code for quantum computing, it has quite a few limitations. As a result, it‚Äôs not in the running as actual error correction, but was crucial as a proof of concept and helped to propel the field forwards.</p>

<p>One main limitation is that it can only handle one arbitrary error. While there are certain arrangements of errors where more than one can be handled, such as a bit flip in each block (totalling three errors), in general one is the limit. For example, if bit flips occur on two qubits in the same block, our bit flip correction code fails to work, giving us the wrong state in the end.</p>

<p>Another limitation is that we assume the error occurs only in one region, and that all of our quantum gates are infallible. In reality though, there‚Äôs no reason why noise from the environment couldn‚Äôt cause errors in our qubits in other parts of the code. Also, it‚Äôs possible for quantum gates to introduce errors as well, since hardware isn‚Äôt perfect. Shor‚Äôs code breaks down once you drop the nice theoretical assumptions we made.</p>

<p>Another limitation is that what we‚Äôre preserving is a single qubit. This doesn‚Äôt make for a very good logical qubit ‚Äì something we can perform quantum algorithms with without worrying much about errors. Even if Shor‚Äôs code protects our qubit from an error, immediately after the code, an error could occur on the qubit. Now, if we tried running Shor‚Äôs code, the error wouldn‚Äôt be fixed, because the new state caused by the error is what would be distributed among the 9 qubits. Modern error correction codes involve logical qubits composed of many physical qubits. That way, when single qubit errors happen, they don‚Äôt destroy the whole logical qubit, and can be detected and corrected for.</p>

<p>Before briefly discussing some of the other error correction codes out there, we‚Äôll look at what‚Äôs called the quantum threshold theorem. The theorem is stated roughly as follows: ‚ÄúQuantum computers with a physical error rate below a certain threshold can, through application of quantum error correction schemes, suppress the logical error rate to arbitrarily low levels.‚Äù</p>

<p>Like with logic gates in classical computers, quantum gates aren‚Äôt infallible. They can introduce errors into our computation, with the ‚Äúphysical error rate‚Äù referring to the probability of that happening. However, with the right error correcting code, we‚Äôre still able to peform long calculations with good precision. The idea is we can fix the errors faster than they pop up.</p>
